I recently to economic this year and loved it! I wanted to use my knowlegde of Econ and find a data set the invole CPI (consumer price index). This data set showed the realtive values of CPI per moth over a two year period. The mean, 275.38224137931036, showed the avrage CPI throughout the two years.
